# stat201-35
Group repository for stat 201 group 35

Instructions: 

create a new fork. This is your copy of the work (you make changes all in here and update our group project later). yours will look like <username>/stat201-35. Copy the link to this fork.

open an editor of your choice (the online jupyter notebook that we use for assignments doesn't support forking with git). In the terminal of your editor (first make sure you're logged in with git) type 'git clone <link of fork>' + enter. You've copied the group project and now can work on your 'copy'. To make changes to the project, I recommend going on to Jupyter notebook and taking the project from here (that way you can use th kernel). To save changes, download the file from jupyter notebook online and replace the old file in your pc's project directory. To upload changes to github like in DSCI100, open the terminal of the editor and enter 'git add .', then "git commit -m '<your message>'", then 'git push'. You have now saved your work to your fork online (you should be able to see it now).

To make the changes so others can see, go to your fork on github at <username>/stat201-35 and click on contribute then open pull request. accept changes and you should see merge. Merge this, now everyone has access to your copy of the work.

enter git fetch to get the latest updates from another group member.
